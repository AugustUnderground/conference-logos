# Conference Logos

Most conferences only provide low quality raster images of their logos. This
is a very bad attempt to automate the process of creating vectorized versions
of conference logos.

## Requirements

The conversion script depends on:

- [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/)
- [vtacer](https://github.com/visioncortex/vtracer)
- [svg2tikz](https://github.com/xyz2tex/svg2tikz)

and a LaTeX compiler to generate the [webversion](https://augustunderground.github.io/conference-logos/).

## Conferences

- [Cadence LIVE](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/company/events/cadence-events.html.html)
- [MLCAD](https://mlcad-workshop.org/)
